class AppLogger:
    """
    AppLogger is a utility class for configuring and managing application-wide logging.

    This class provides a mechanism to set up a logger instance with customizable settings
    and formats based on the application's environment. It supports both JSON-formatted logs
    for production environments and human-readable logs for other environments. The logger
    is designed to avoid duplicate handlers and ensures proper configuration of log levels
    and output formats.

    Attributes:
        settings (Settings): An instance of the `Settings` class containing configuration
            options such as `log_level` and `app_env`.

    Methods:
        __init__(settings: Settings):
            Initializes the AppLogger instance with the provided settings.

        setup():
            Sets the logging level and output format based on the application environment.

        get_logger(name: str) -> logging.Logger:
            Retrieves a logger instance with the specified name.

        Configures the logger instance with the appropriate settings and formatters.

        This method sets the logging level based on the `log_level` attribute from the settings.
        It also configures the log output format depending on the application environment:
        - In "production" environment, logs are formatted in JSON.
        - In other environments, logs are formatted in a human-readable format.

        The method ensures that duplicate log handlers are avoided by clearing existing handlers
        before adding a new one.
